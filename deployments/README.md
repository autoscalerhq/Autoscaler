## How to Use

1. **Choose the appropriate directory** based on your deployment model and target environment.
2. **Review the examples and templates** provided within the subdirectory to understand their structure and usage.
3. **Customize the configurations** according to your application's requirements and infrastructure specifics.
4. **Deploy the configurations** using relevant tools (e.g., `docker-compose`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `terraform`, etc.).

### Example Deployment

To deploy a multi-container application using Docker Compose:

1. Navigate to the `/docker-compose` directory.
2. Open and review the relevant `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Modify the file to match your application's image names, environment variables, volumes, and network settings.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application.

To deploy an application using Kubernetes and Helm:

1. Navigate to the `/kubernetes/helm` directory.
2. If using Helm, inspect the available charts and modify `values.yaml` to fit your needs.
3. Deploy the application using `kubectl apply -f <manifest.yaml>` for Kubernetes manifests or `helm install <release-name> <chart-name>` for Helm charts.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Follow the directory structure and naming conventions.
2. Provide clear and concise comments/documentation within your configuration files.
3. Test your configurations to ensure they work as intended.
4. Submit a pull request with a descriptive message detailing the changes and purpose of the deployment configuration.
