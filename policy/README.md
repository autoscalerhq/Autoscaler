# Welcome to your playground!

This environment lets you learn as you go and experiment with Cerbos right here. No setup needed, no “works on my machine” bias, just you and your policies.

## Policy files

You can add new `resource`, `derived role`, or `principal` policies on the left.

For syntax of the policy files, please see [the documentation](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/index.html).

## Testing actions for principals and resources

You can add multiple `principal` and `resource` definitions on the right.
At any point, you can see whether the listed `actions` are allowed or disallowed on the right.

Alternatively, `Check all` button allow bulk checks for all the principals or resources.
